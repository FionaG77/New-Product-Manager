周总结会迟到，但永远不会缺席，哈哈哈~</br>
# 1. Structure 近期系统性的学习内容
[1）《Cracking the pm interview》]()</br>
一共18章，我最感兴趣的是11章“Define Yourself”，本来以为一个小时能读12页，最后连看加做笔记，大概看了3页。</br>
主要是比较好的回答句，摘抄下来：</br>
```Java
数据效果说明：This has resulted in about a 15% increase in paying users.
项目介绍完毕收尾：I can go into more detail about my work at *** if you'd like.
额外优势介绍(懂编程、写产品博客、会管理团队并有数据支持)：
Outside of work,I do a bit of coding for fun,participating in hackathons.
I also run a blog focused on the New York City music scene.
I manage a team of ten writers.We get about 100000 visits per month.
为什么想加入创业公司（我的职业偏好+我过往的经验很适合这个岗位）：
I'm looking now for a role at an early-stage company where I'll be able to take a single product from conception to launch. 
It's at the perfect time for me to dive in,and it's so closely related to the personalization work I'm doing right now.
个人发光点陈述where she's shined: Form a cohesive(有凝聚力的) story about what's she's good at and why she loves being a PM.
This is your opportunity to sell yourself.
内容是PM素质or和产品相关，不说废话。Whether that's aspects of the PM role specifically(特定的) or the company's product.
judge you in part of your communication skills.
Do可行：
1）业余生活展示你的优点Do：extracurricular（业余）if you're applying to fitness-related startup(健身),that's a good thing to mention.
It shows a passion for the space,and possibly even expertise（专业） in it.
Even when the extracurriculars are not directly applicable,they can often show initiative(主动性) and leadership（领导力）.
2）客观听你自己的面试应答Do：How does it sound to them?
You might even want to record your pitch for yourself so you can hear how it sounds.
3）聊聊面试官Do:A good rule of thumb is to speak one to two times as long as your interviewer did,if she introduced herself.（没太懂，夸夸面试官做的产品？）Otherwise,about two minutes is a good guide.
Don't尽量避免：
1）不要陷于细节Don't:That can come off as too boastful（自夸自负）,and your interviewer might even got lost in all the details.
定位清晰，匹配岗位。Your pitch(定位) should be a cohesive story（一个紧凑的故事） that how(是不是What) you got from then to now.（从以前到现在你获得了什么工作能力和经验） 
It should offer context(上下文、背景) for why you're a good fit（匹配者） for the job.
2）说话不要太技术。Don't:Your interview wants to hear in more straight forward language why that work was important.After all,as a PM,you need to communicate with both technical and non-technical people.
3）不要太抽象，举例说明经验和应用。Don't speak too abstractly.Instead of just saying you did customer research and wrote specs,talk about an example of something important you learned and how you changed the product based on that.
4）不要太无聊，形成一个立体紧凑的故事。Don't be boring and just rattle off（急促背诵） a bunch of facts about yourself.
(编织)Weave your pitch into a mini story.
You should look forward to this question.
This is your opportunity to sell your interviewer on why you're the perfect candidate,and you'll be perfectly prepared to do so.

问题：为什么想来这里工作？Why work here.
Many answers would be something along the lines of(离不开这几条)...
These answers are okay,but they're just okay.
You won't win any points(赢分) dilvering（通过传达） an answer like that.
Because you haven't given me anything that makes me want to hire you more.(激发雇佣你的欲望)
An ideal answer will sell youself in some way.
Consider one or more of these aspects into your answer.(目前就读到这)
```

# 2. Review 本周对以往工作学习的新思考
### 做每一个动作时，都要思考，如果碰到质问，要有理有据。--hq总
从上级看，上上级看，你的工作内容是什么，产出是什么，有什么问题，怎么避免。</br>
问题确实难，但也确实要解决，学学别人怎么做的。</br>

# 3. Job-Hopping 跳槽准备
### 职位寻找
找到了微软社招节信息，有1、2个职位，收集整理了相关面经。</br>

# 4. Tip 学到的零散知识或感悟
### 不要怕
到底要多努力才能过好这一生？</br>
要极度痛苦才愿意改变，我是这种人。</br>
早点改变，不要拖延。（最重要的一句）</br>

# 5. Share 分享实用观点
### 职场技巧交流
闺蜜群里会一起讨论职场上遇到的问题，和解决方案，在各自的岗位上，我们都努力着，讨论一些经验，互相分享。</br>
1、实习时（我大三实习的经验）：超出公司对实习生的期待。说到做到。</br>
2、工作上：和领导保持沟通多上报，让老板参与其中，起码心里有数，沟通不到的，用工作成果为自己说话。</br>
```
一个人，不笨，愿意干活，多思考，多提升工作能力和职场技巧，我不信她会混不好。
```

# 6. Plan 下周计划

```
必做：
    1、项目应答准备好。
    2、只有一件事：托福单词背完。
    3、练琴。
```
